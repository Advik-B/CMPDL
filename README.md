## What is CMPDL

CMPDL (CurseForge Modpack Downloader) is an app that helps in downloading mods from a modpack (Not possible by a human)

If you are new to [minecraft](https://minecraft.net), you may not understand what this does. If you not ... Buddy. You Came To The Right Place ðŸ™‚

This app will download all the mods to your desired folder from a modpack (zip) file

### How it works

Every modpack is a zip file, In that zip file... there is a file called `manifest.json`

In `manifest.json` there is info about:

- Modpack Name
- What mods were used:
  - Mod Name
  - Mod ID (`project id`)
  - File ID
  - Whether it is required or not

My Program will collect the above info and generate direct download links for the mods
And it will download them one by one & save it in your dest folder
